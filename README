PyMC Multilevel Example
=======================

A nice example of using PyMC for multilevel (aka "Random Effects")
modeling came through on the PyMC mailing list today.  I've put it
into a git repo so that I can play around with it a little, and
collect up the feedback that the list generates.

The original message, from Scott B, lays out the situation with
refreshing precision.  I continue to be impressed with the skill-level
that new PyMC users frequently begin with (for fun, compare to the
questions on the NetworkX mailing list sometime...  I guess this is an
indication of the relative success in the popularization of network
science and Bayesian statistics).

Anyways, here is the original message::

     Hi All,

     New to this group and to PyMC (and mostly new to Python). In any case,
     I'm writing to ask for help in specifying a multilevel model (mixed
     model) for what I call partially clustered designs. An example of a
     partially clustered design is a 2-condition randomized psychotherapy
     study where subjects are randomly assigned to conditions. In condition
     1, subjects are treated in small groups of say 8 people a piece. In
     the condition 2, usually a control, subjects are only assessed on the
     outcome (they don't receive an intervention). Thus you have clustering
     in condition 1 but not condition 2.

     The model for a 2-condition study looks like (just a single time point
     to keep things simpler):

     y_ij = b_0 + b_1*Tx + u_j*Tx + e_ij

     where y_ij is the outcome for the ith person in cluster j (in most
     multilevel modeling software and in PROC MCMC in SAS, subjects in the
     unclustered condition are all in clusters of just 1 person), b_0 is
     the overall intercept, b_1 is the treatment effect, Tx is a dummy
     coded variable coded as 1 for the clustered condition and 0 for the
     unclustered condition, u_j is the random effect for cluster j, and
     e_ij is the residual error. The variance among clusters is \sigma^2_u
     and the residual term is \sigma^2_e (ideally you would estimate a
     unique residual by condition).

     Because u_j interacts with Tx, the random effect is only contributes
     to the clustered condition.

     In my PyMC model, I expressed the model in matrix form - I find it
     easier to deal with especially for dealing with the cluster effects.
     Namely:

     Y = XB + ZU + R

     where X is an n x 2 design matrix for the overall intercept and
     intervention effect, B is a 1 x 2 matrix of regression coefficients, Z
     is an n x c design matrix for the cluster effects (where c is equal to
     the number of clusters in the clustered condition), and U is a c x 1
     matrix of cluster effects. The way I've written the model below, I
     have R as an n x n diagonal matrix with \sigma^2_e on the diagonal and
     0's on the off-diagonal.

     All priors below are based on a model fit in PROC MCMC in SAS. I'm
     trying to replicate the analyses in PyMC so I don't want to change the
     priors.

     The data for my code can be downloaded here:
     http://dl.dropbox.com/u/613463/run1.csv

     The data consist of 200 total subjects. 100 in the clustered condition
     and 100 in the unclustered. In the clustered condition there are 10
     clusters of 10 people each. There is a single outcome variable.

     The PyMC set-up file can be downloaded here (also pasted below):
     http://dl.dropbox.com/u/613463/analysis1.py

     The file for running the PyMC set-up file can be downloaded here:
     http://dl.dropbox.com/u/613463/run_analysis1.py

     I have 3 specific questions about the model:

     1 - Given the description of the model, have I successfully specified
     the model? The results are quite similar to PROC MCMC, though the
     cluster variance (\sigma^2_u) differs more than I would expect due to
     Monte Carlo error. The differences make me wonder if I haven't got it
     quite right in PyMC.

     2 - Is there a better (or more efficient) way to set up the model? The
     model runs quickly but I am trying to learn Python and to get better
     at optimizing how to set up models (especially multilevel models).

     3 - How can change my specification so that I can estimate unique
     residual variances for clustered and unclustered conditions? Right now
     I've estimated just a single residual variance. But I typically want
     separate estimates for the residual variances per intervention
     condition.

     Thanks so much for your help. My code follows my signature.

     Best,
     Scott

Here are my notes on the matter:

1.  This code worked for me without any modification. :) Although when
    I tried to run it twice in the same ipython session, it gave me
    strange complaints. (for pymc version 2.1alpha, wall time 78s).
    For the newest version in the git repo (pymc version 2.2grad,
    commit ca77b7aa28c75f6d0e8172dd1f1c3f2cf7358135, wall time 75s) it
    didn't complain.

2.  I find the data wrangling section of the model quite opaque.  If
    there is a difference between the PROC MCMC and PyMC results, this
    is the first place I would look.  I've been searching for the most
    transparent ways to deal with data in Python, so I can share some
    of my findings as applied to this block of code.

3.  The model could probably be faster.  This is the time for me to
    recall the two cardinal rules of program optimization: 1) Don't
    Optimize, and 2) (for experts only) Don't Optimize Yet.

    That said, the biggest change to the time PyMC takes to run is in
    the step methods.  But adjusting this is a delicate operation.
    More on this to follow.

4.  Changing the specification is the true power of the PyMC approach,
    and why this is worth the extra effort, since a random effects
    model like yours is one line of STATA.  So I'd like to write out
    in detail how to change it.  More on this to follow.

5.  Indentation should be 4 spaces.  Diverging from this inane detail
    will make python people itchy.
